Based on the code you provided, there doesn't seem to be an obvious bug. However, there are a few things that you may want to check or improve to ensure that the code works as intended:

It looks like the fread function is being used to read data from a file. You may want to make sure that the file exists and is opened correctly before using fread. Also, make sure that PKT_PAYLOAD_MAX is defined to be a reasonable value that won't cause issues with reading data.

After the fread function is called, the fclose function is being used to close the file. However, it seems like the file should be closed after all of the data has been read and processed. You may want to move the fclose function call outside of the while loop.

The string array is being used to store the data read from the file. You may want to make sure that this array is large enough to hold the data that you are trying to read. If the array is not large enough, it could cause buffer overflows or other memory-related issues
